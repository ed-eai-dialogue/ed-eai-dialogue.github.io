  <h1 class="title pt-6">About</h1>
  <hr/>

  <p>The fields of cognitive neuroscience and AI have a long and intertwined history. Many of the early pioneers straddled both fields. However, this strong interaction has become less common as both fields have grown enormously in complexity and disciplinary boundaries have solidified. With the advent of new experimental and analysis techniques and with the emergence of large international research initiatives, alongside recent advances in computer architectures, the resurgence of interest in cognitive neuroscience as a rich source for revolutionizing foundational AI studies has led to an exciting new synergy between the two fields. The workshop provides a venue that largely facilitates collaboration of researchers from both communities, with a strong emphasis on learning dynamics and its neural foundations, a cornerstone of human intelligence.</p>
  
  <h1 class="title pt-6">Rationale, Uniqueness, and Continuity</h1>
  <hr/>

  <p>Humans are widely regarded as the most advanced and sophisticated autonomous systems, possessing remarkable problem-solving capabilities that naturally adapt to dynamic and changing environments. A crucial stage leading to these capabilities is early cognitive development, where infants and young children learn to autonomously explore the environment through active sensing, by generating actions, perceiving their outcomes, forming goals, extracting rules and regularities, making causal inferences, and generating predictions. This spontaneous learning process unfolds during an intense period of brain maturation/reorganization as infants and children produce a large number of behavioral repetitions. For each new cycle of interaction with the environment, infants collect data, update, and diversify their perceptual and motor skills incrementally, leading to a self-organizational process associated with changes in neural dynamics, connectivity, and increasingly elaborated cognitive functions.</p>

  <p>Existing embodied AI systems, on the other hand, often struggle to match the adaptability and robustness exhibited by humans. These systems tend to encounter significant challenges when faced with incomplete or ambiguous information, as well as handling unforeseen scenarios or novel situations. We argue that the most critical missing component in these AI instantiations is the incorporation of early developmental dynamicsâ€”a cornerstone of human intelligence.</p>

  <p>The proposed workshop aims to initiate a dialogue among AI/ML researchers, neurocognitive scientists, and mathematicians toward bridging the critical gap between early cognitive development and embodied AI. We plan to develop this workshop into a yearly event to facilitate active communication and cross-disciplinary collaboration, fostering a community and preparing a workforce for the next wave of AI evolution. A broad range of topics can be discussed under the general theme of the workshop, including, for example, embodiment, learning dynamics, brain-inspired systems, multi-sensory integration, robustness, early language development, sustainable and socially acceptable sensing, causal inference, security and privacy, and decision making. Each year, the organizers will identify a different set of topics to help guide discussions; and to emphasize the dialogue nature of the workshop, two invited talks will be arranged discussing the same topic from the early cognitive development perspective and the embodied intelligence perspective, respectively. For this 1st Workshop, the selected topics are a bit broader: 1) Embodiment, 2) Learning Dynamics, and 3) Brain-inspired Systems. A planning workshop was held at Gatlinburg, TN, May 31 - June 1, 2024, where we invited collaborators from closely-related fields to exchange recent findings and brainstorm on the format, topics, and potential speakers of the proposed workshop. This very initial dialogue between the two otherwise divided communities has been quite inspiring and exciting.</p>

  <p>A quick scan of NeurIPS workshops in the past four years (2020 - 2023) reveals only 5 that cover some aspects of the inter-relationship between AI and human intelligence, including Toward Human-Level Mathematical Reasoning (2022), Shared Visual Representations in Human and Machine Intelligence (2021), Human and Machine Decisions (2021), BabyMind: How Babies Learn and How Machines Can Imitate (2020), Biological and Artificial Reinforcement Learning (2020). None of these five workshops focus on the driving force differentiating human intelligence and the current AI practice, i.e., learning dynamics. The proposed workshop will fill in this critical gap and help make a significant contribution to propel next-generation AI evolution!</p>

  <h1 class="title pt-6">Diversity and Inclusion</h1>
